# K’uychi

**Color shade generator with copyable hexadecimal values, based on a base
tone.**

## About the Project

K’uychi (which means “rainbow” in Quechua) is a desktop application designed to
facilitate the creation of color palettes. It allows users to select a base
color and, from this, automatically generates a series of “shades” or variants
of that same color (lighter and darker). Each shade generated can be easily
copied in hexadecimal format, making integration into web/UI/UX design or
development projects extremely simple.

The app aims to be a useful tool both for designers who need to explore color
gradients and for developers seeking consistency in their interface palettes.

## Main Features

- **Shade Generation:** From a single color, create a complete range of its
  variants.
- **Copy in Hexadecimal:** One click is all it takes to copy the hexadecimal
  value of any shade.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Designed with GTK and libadwaita for a smooth and
  modern user experience.

## Used Technologies

K’uychi is built on a stack of modern technologies focused on the GNOME
platform:

- **GJS (GNOME JavaScript):** The basis for application development.
- **TypeScript:** Adds static typing and robustness to JavaScript code.
- **esbuild:** Used as a bundler to compile and optimize code.
- **colorjs.io:** Robust and accurate library for color manipulation and shade
  generation.
- **GTK & libadwaita:** Frameworks for building graphical user interfaces,
  following the GNOME HIG (Human Interface Guidelines).
- **Flatpak:** Packaging and development environment for consistent and isolated
  configuration.
- **npm:** The package manager used to manage project dependencies.

## How to Contribute

I would love for you to join this project! K’uychi is constantly evolving, and
all contributions are welcome, whether it be code, UI improvements, bug reports,
or new ideas.

### Prerequisites

To start developing K’uychi, you will only need:

- **Flatpak:** To set up the development environment and run the application.

### Recommended Development Environments

For an optimal development experience with K’uychi, we recommend the following
integrated development environments (IDEs):

- **GNOME Builder:** Native integration with Flatpak and GNOME/GTK projects.
- **VS Code / VSCodium:** With the Flatpak extension to facilitate interaction
  with the development environment.

### Development Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment. The
instructions vary slightly depending on the IDE you choose:

#### Using GNOME Builder

GNOME Builder is designed to work seamlessly with Flatpak and GNOME projects.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Open GNOME Builder, press “Clone Repository...”, and enter the URL of the
   K’uychi repository: `https://codeberg.org/nyx_lyb3ra/Kuychi.git`

2. **Open and configure the project:**

   Once cloned, Builder should automatically detect the Flatpak configuration
   and project files.

3. **Build and run:**

   Builder will take care of setting up the Flatpak environment, installing
   dependencies, and building/running the application. Simply click the “Run”
   button (the ▶️ button at the header bar) to start.

#### Using VS Code / VSCodium

For VS Code/VSCodium, the key is the Flatpak extension and manual installation
of the necessary SDKs.

1. **Install the Flatpak extension:**

   Open VS Code/VSCodium, go to the extensions section, search for “Flatpak”
   from “Bilal Elmoussaoui,” and install it.

2. **Install the Flatpak dependencies:**

   Make sure you have the following platforms and extensions from the Flatpak
   SDK installed from Flathub. Open a terminal and run:

   ```sh
   flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Sdk//48
   flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform//48
   flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.node24//24.08
   flatpak install flathub org.flatpak.Builder//stable
   ```

3. **Clone and open the project:**

   Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, search for “Git:
   Clone,” and paste the repository URL:
   `https://codeberg.org/nyx_lyb3ra/Kuychi.git`. Once cloned, VS Code will ask
   if you want to open the folder.

4. **Build and run:**

   The Flatpak extension in VS Code will configure the Flatpak development
   environment, install dependencies, and manage the build. You can build and
   run the application directly using:

   - The keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>
   - The Command Palette: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, then search for and
     select “Flatpak: Build.”

### Project Structure

The folder structure of K’uychi is similar to that of standard GNOME/GTK
projects:

- `.vscode/`: Includes general settings and recommendations for development in
  VS Code / VSCodium, making it easier to configure the IDE for new
  contributors.
- `bin/`: Contains the files that will act as executable “binaries” for the
  application.
- `data/`: Stores extra files and application resources, such as icons,
  `.desktop` entries, GSettings schemas, and screenshots.
- `patches/`: If patches are needed for npm dependencies, they are stored in
  this folder.
- `po/`: Contains the translation files (.po) for the internationalization of
  the application.
- `scripts/`: Contains help scripts that are used during the application
  compilation and packaging process.
- `src/`: Here you will find all the source code for the application (GJS and
  TypeScript).
